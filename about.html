        <h1>About the Speed Trains in India</h1>
        <p>
            <pre>
India has a system of express trains, operated by Indian Railways which comes under the purview of the Ministry of Railways of Government 
of 
India.As of 2023, it maintains over 108,706 km (67,547 mi) of tracks and operates nearly 3,000 express trains daily.
According to the Ministry of Railways, express trains travel faster and have limited stops than ordinary passenger trains. 
 Any passenger train with an average speed higher than 55 km/h (34 mph) is considered super-fast.
As of 2023, India does not have any operational high-speed trains. The maximum operational speed of 160 km/h (99 mph) 
is achieved by Gatimaan Express and Rani Kamalapati (Habibganj)–Hazrat Nizamuddin Vande Bharat Express on the Tughlakabad–Agra section.
Earlier steam locomotive operated trains largely operated below 100 km/h (62 mph). With the introduction of electric locomotives 
in later 1920s and newer steam locomotives, speeds of 100 km/h (62 mph) were achieved. With the movement to AC traction in late 1950s
 and introduction of diesel locomotives, maximum speeds of up to 120 km/h (75 mph) were achieved in the late 1960s. With the introduction 
 of high power electric locomotives in the 1990s, operating speeds of 130 km/h (81 mph) was achieved with further developments leading to 
 speeds of maximum speeds of 160 km/h (99 mph) being realized in the early 2010s. Vande Bharat Express, an Electric Multiple Unit (EMU) run 
 service introduced in 2019, is the fastest operational express train with a maximum permitted speed of 160 km/h (99 mph).
